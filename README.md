# Experimental PHP Framework using Twig Template Engine

## This is a prototype of my bug tracking system.
### I just tried using twig template engine, I also created simple php router that is most like a lot of frameworks.

Note: this is not recommended for production.

Technologies stack used: HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, TailwindCSS, Twig PHP Template Engine.

If you want to test this out. Just do follow the ff instructions:

  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaedi/experimental-php-framework-using-twig.git
  ```

  ```



##The official bug tracking app will be released soon.
